# Stopwatch Web Application â€“ Task 02

This project is part of my **Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
It is a fully functional **Stopwatch Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Start / Pause / Reset** functionality
- **Lap time recording** to capture intermediate intervals
- **Accurate time tracking** in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
- **Responsive UI** for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Clean and intuitive design**

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- HTML â€“ Structuring the stopwatch interface
- CSS â€“ Styling the layout and buttons
- JavaScript â€“ Handling the stopwatch logic, time calculations, and events

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
1. **Start** â€“ Begins the timer and updates the display in real-time.  
2. **Pause** â€“ Stops the timer without resetting the recorded time.  
3. **Reset** â€“ Resets the timer to zero and clears recorded laps.  
4. **Lap** â€“ Records the current time while the stopwatch continues running.
